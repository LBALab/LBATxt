 KNOWN PROBLEM: If you cannot compile (or run under the Delphi environment) the program because of "Error opening file ConvTbl.dfm" error, don't worry and just try to compile/run it again. Works for me. No idea why this problem occurs.
 
 This program can edit lbt (text) files from Little Big Adventure 1 & 2
