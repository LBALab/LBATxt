 - Slightly changed version numbering,
 - Fixed some bugs in program languages support and example language file (reported by pkome),

### Changes in version 2.02:

 - Fixed: Menus are now working properly under Win98 (thanks OBrasilo)
 - Fixed: Menu colour selection sub-menu now remembers last setting
 - New: Program now can open and save xml files. See "Save as" dialog filetype filter.
 - New: German, Portugese and Chinese (simplified) translations of the program are included. Sorry guys, but it's been log time since I got them, and I don't remember who actually sent them to me. If you want to be credited just remind me :).


 ### Changes in version 2.01b:
 
 - Fixed: some translation bugs.
 - Added: "Go to text:" option. To use it type the text number and press enter.
 - Improved: Program now uses my unit that gives XP-style to menus and toolbars instead of Delphi's ActionToolbar, thus you will be able to open source code in Delphi 7 Personal, and the program looks overally nicer.
